A Novel Approach for Object Detection	
April 2018-May 2019


An efficient Trafic Sign detection system based on Convolutional Neural Network - Long Short-Term Memory



A Novel Approach for Object Detection, is modeled around a real-world problem aimed at the effectiveness of detecting traffic signs to provide suggestive correct actions to human drivers and reduce road accidents. Our team utilized the incremental Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) to propose a system based on a CNN-LSTM (Convolutional Neural Network - Long Short-Term Memory) in order to produce precise results after every increment. The real-time images were transformed into a set of features followed by their extraction using LSTM for dimensionality reduction where the output was reduced by property measurements feeding the final results into a classifier. By embedding LSTM in CNN for better image classification we significantly reduced the computational limitation resulting in better image classification.
